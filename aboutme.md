Hi, I'm a computer engineer who has been working for ten years as an oil engineer at Petrobras and is looking to learn new things like Data Science since it seems I won't be old enough when humanity stops using oil, so I have to adapt as soon as possible. Also, I love programming and feel like Data Science is the dream job for me, so I decided to chase the dream, because, as someone once said, "It's the journey that matters in the end."
